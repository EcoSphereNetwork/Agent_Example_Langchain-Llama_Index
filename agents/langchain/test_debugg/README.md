The Multi-Agent Assistant is a versatile tool that combines advanced AI capabilities with a user-friendly web interface. It includes agents for:

    Critical log analysis
    Dependency conflict resolution
    Real-time log monitoring
    NPM package management

The system features a React-based frontend and a Flask backend with WebSocket support for real-time log updates. Itâ€™s designed to automate development workflows, analyze logs, and manage project dependencies interactively.
Features

    Critical Log Analysis:
        Parse logs using regex for ERROR, WARNING, and CRITICAL messages.
        Visualize logs in real-time via a web dashboard.

    Dependency Management:
        Detect and resolve version conflicts using metadata from the NPM registry.
        Automatically run npm audit fix and npm install.

    Real-Time Monitoring:
        Watch log files dynamically and emit real-time updates to the frontend.

    Multi-Agent Collaboration:
        Multiple AI agents collaborate for specialized tasks:
            Log analysis
            Dependency management
            Automated test execution
            Performance analysis

    Interactive Web Interface:
        Query agents and view real-time responses through a React-based UI.

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-agent-assistant.git
cd multi-agent-assistant

2. Backend Setup

    Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the Flask backend:

    python backend.py

3. Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd multi-agent-ui

Install Node.js dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

    npm start

Usage
Query the Agent

    Open the web interface in your browser: http://localhost:3000
    Enter queries like:
        "Analyze logs for critical issues."
        "Resolve dependency conflicts."
        "Run npm install."

Real-Time Log Monitoring

    Logs are monitored in the ./logs directory.
    New log updates are emitted in real-time to the web interface.

Command-Line Interface

For CLI users, the system offers direct query support:

python backend.py --query "Analyze logs for critical issues."

Endpoints

    POST /api/query
        Send a query to the agents.
        Request Body:

{ "query": "Your query here" }

Response:

    { "response": "Agent's response" }

GET /api/logs

    Retrieve parsed logs.
    Response:

        { "ERROR": [...], "WARNING": [...], "CRITICAL": [...] }

Development and Debugging

    Debug Logs: Logs are saved to debug.log (rotated at 1MB, retained for 7 days).
    Real-Time Monitoring: The backend dynamically watches the ./logs directory for changes.
